***** Installation *****

1. Install all the dependencies (You dont need to do this if using LuaRocks
   if should have done it for you already)
2. Create a mysql database and an appropriate user with at least insert,
   select, create table rights.
   (You only need select rights if you create the tables yourself, see
   the plugins code for table schema)
3. Fill in the database tables:
   1- tHost: Add each domain name(FQDN) that the server recognizes as its own
   2- tAccount: Add each account that the server should recognizes.
      - acc_s_name / acc_s_host: the <account>@<host> parts of the mail address
      - acc_e_type:
        - 'account' real(but not unix user) account
        - 'alias' alias to an other account
        - 'forward' relay to external domain
        - 'deposit' do not use the default deposit plugin
      - acc_e_active: 'yes' to active the account, 'no' to disable it
      - acc_s_pass: The password for the account, or NULL
        (only for type set to 'account')
      - ass_s_param: For 'alias' type a comma-separed list of accounts to forward,
        for 'forward' the external address, for 'deposit' a config string
        depending on the plugin
   3- (Optionnal) Configure tDropFilter to filter mails into various maildirs,
      see docs/Plugin.Filter.txt
4. Configure config/smtp.config.lua to meet your needs(copy it
   to /etc/tethys/smtp.config.lua for Tethys to find it automatically)
5. Create the directories you listed in the configuration file(and set
   owner/group accordingly if needed)
6. Run:
   - bin/tethys2-receiver (only if you need to receive mail)
   - bin/tethys2-sender (only if you need to send mail)

***** Extra Programs *****
- bin/tethys2-localdrop: Takes an account@host that is local to this server and
  drop the mail it receives from standart input in it, using the deposit and
  filter plugins specified in the configuration file
- bin/tethys2-sendmail: Takes a list of account@host and delivers the mail it
  gets from standart input to the relay-maildir for the sender daemon to relay.
  Basically this .. sends mails ..
