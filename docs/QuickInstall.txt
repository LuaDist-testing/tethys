## Using virtual accounts with MySQL

Using this setup you will have a mail system with virtual users handled by MySQL.

Create a mysql database for Tethys and a user with SELECT and CREATE TABLE grants.

Copy the file config/smtp.config.lua in the distribution to /etc/tethys2/smtp.config.lua.
Edit it to fit your system, the file is commented and most values should work by default.

Append to it the content of config/mysql.user-manager.config.lua and 
config/unixalias.user-manager.config.lua. 
Edit the values to fit with your MySQL configuration.

Start Tethys (bin/tethys2-receiver and bin/tethys2-sender).

Log in mysql and start creating accounts in the table tAccount and add hosts in tHost.
By default there will be one host entry for the main domain defined in the config file
and one entry for a postmaster account on this domain.
You can add a new host this way:
INSERT INTO tHost SET hst_s_host='foo.org', hst_e_default='bounce';
And a new account:
INSERT INTO tAccount SET acc_s_name='myuser', acc_s_host='foo.org', acc_e_type='account';

If you want to use an account to check mails with Dovecot (check the dovecot interfacing
docs) or use an account to allow SMTP login from remote hosts to relay mails you must
set the acc_s_pass to the plain text password you wish to use.

Well done, you can now receive and send emails!

## Using real unix system accounts

Using this setup you will have a mail system delivering to unix system accounts and
using unix alias file to do aliases.

Copy the file config/smtp.config.lua in the distribution to /etc/tethys2/smtp.config.lua.
Edit it to fit your system, the file is commented and most values should work by default.

Append to it the content of config/unixalias.user-manager.config.lua.
Edit the values to fit your system.

Start Tethys (bin/tethys2-receiver and bin/tethys2-sender).

Well done, you can now receive and send emails!
