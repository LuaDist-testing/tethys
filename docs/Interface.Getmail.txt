Interfacing with Getmail(a replacement for fetchmail; http://pyropus.ca/software/getmail/) is very easy.

If you just want to use getmail to fetch mail from distant hosts and use Tethys filters just configure
the [destination] section as follow:
type = MDA_external
path = /usr/local/tethys/bin/tethys-localdrop
arguments = ("account", "host")
user = mail
group = mail

Change the values as needed, and you are now set!
