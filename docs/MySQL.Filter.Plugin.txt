This plugin works with the DiskSpool/Maildir deposit plugin and allows it to handle maildir++
format, that is maildir with sub-maildirs.

Each line is a filter configured as follow:
- acc_s_name / acc_s_host: the <account>@<host> mail address corresponding to the account to filter for (use 'account' types, not aliases)
- dft_e_type: 'header'/'notheader' to filter on a mail header or 'lua' for a custom lua function
- dft_s_param: The lua code for lua filter. For 'header'/'notheader' it is (ALWAYS in lowercase):
               <header-field>:<string to match>
- dft_ee_result:
  - delete: delete the mail
  - move: move to the sub-maildir of name specified in "dft_s_dest"
  - read: mark as already read(drops in cur/ instead of new/ of the maildir)

Exemple:
   acc_s_name: darkgod
   acc_s_host: net-core.org
   dft_e_type: header
  dft_s_param: subject:tethys
dft_ee_result: move
   dft_s_dest: Tethys

This will move all mails whose subject contains "tethys" into a maildir known as "Tethys" for the user darkgod@net-core.org
